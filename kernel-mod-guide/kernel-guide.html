        <h1> How To Modify the Ubuntu Kernel</h1>
        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
           This guide assumes you are currently running ubuntu 12.1 and are planning on 
           using the 3.5 kernel. It also assumes git is installed on the computer.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting The Kernel Source</h2>
        <p>
            To acquire the kernel, first open Terminal. Then type the following commands
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
                <b>git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-quantal.git</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            This will create a folder in the working directory containing the kernel. Bear
            in mind this will take a while and takes up about 700 MB of disk space. Note 
            that this command is specific to the ubuntu-quantal kernel. If you want to
            modify a different kernel, you can change the <b>ubuntu-quantal.git</b>
            segment of the command to the desired release.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding the System Call</h2>
        <p>
            To add a system call, you have to add some lines to a couple of files. All 
            said and done it is not very much code, but the files can be hard to find.
            The first one you want to work with is 
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
                <b>~/ubuntu-quantal/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this is for 32-bit operating systems. For 64-bit operating systems,
            you will want to modify syscall_64.tbl, which is in the same directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            To this file, you will want to add the following line:
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
                <b>350     i386   hello                 sys_hello</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            This will add the intended system call to the kernel's table of system calls.
            It should fall right after the call <b>349 kcmp</b> Note that the <b>i386</b>
            bit will be different if you are using a different processor architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next you will want to navigate to 
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
                <b>~/ubuntu-quantal/include/linux/syscalls.h</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            To that file, add the following line
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
                <b>asmlinkage long sys_hello(void);</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            This defines the skeleton of the system call, which is included in other
            files along with the meat of the code itself. Next we will add the actual 
            file containing the system call. Navigate to the folder
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
                <b>~/ubuntu-quantal/kernel</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this folder create a new folder called <b>hello</b>. Navigate to that 
            folder, <b>~/ubuntu-quantal/kernel/hello</b>, and create a file called 
            <b>hello.c</b>. In this file, write the following code:
            <div>
                <PRE><b>
                #include &#60;linux/syscall.h>
                #include &#60;linux/init.h>
                #include &#60;linux/kernel.h>
                #include &#60;linux/linkage.h>
                
                asmlinkage long sys_hello(void) {
                    printk("Hello, World!\n");
                    return 0;
                }
                </b></PRE>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            This file contains the core of the system call. It is this file that tells
            the system what to do when the call is invoked. In this case, it simply
            emits "Hello, World!" into the kernel log.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That is it in terms of creating the system call, but there are some other 
            files to create or modify to help build the kernel. First, create a file in
            <b>~/ubuntu-quantal/kernel/hello</b> called <b>Makefile</b>. This file should
            contain the following code
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
                <b>obj-$(CONFIG_HELLO) += hello.o</b>
            </div>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now change to the directory <b>~/ubuntu-quantal/kernel</b> and create a file
            called <b>Kconfig.hello</b>. In this file, type the following:
            <PRE><b>
                config HELLO
                bool "emit Hello World"
                default y
                help
                    "This file will emit Hello World into the kernel log"
            </PRE></b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Finally move to the root directory of the kernel (<b>~/ubuntu-quantal/</b>)
            and open the file called <b>Makefile</b>. In this file, edit the file so the 
            line starting with <b>EXTRAVERSION</b> near the top reads
            <PRE><b>
                EXTRAVERSION =.syscall
            </PRE></b>
            
        </p>
                
            
        <h2>Setting Up the Build Environment</h2>
        <p>
           Before building the kernel, you must set up your system to properly build
           and modify the kernel. This will involve acquiring some software
           changing the configuration of the kernel. Type the following commands as
           recommended by <a href="http://blog.avirtualhome.com/how-to-compile-a-new-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-kernel">
           this guide to kernel compilation</a>. 
           <div >
               <b>sudo su - <br>
                apt-get install fakeroot build-essential<br>
                apt-get install crash kexec-tools makedumpfile kernel-wedge<br>
                apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)<br>
                apt-get install git libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libnewt-dev<br>
                exit<br>
               </b>
           </div>
        </p>
        <p> 
           This will get you all the different packages needed to modify the configuration
           and modify the kernel. Fakeroot is used to clean and start the build of the kernel, the 
           build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r) is used in the process of actually building the
           kernel, and libncurses5 is used in the config step to display the configuration
           menu.
        </p>
        <p>
           To modify the configuration, run the following commands. According to 
           the ubuntu wiki, this step is optional, but we will do it anyway.
           <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
               <b>chmod a+x debian/scripts/*</b>
           </div>
           <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
               <b>chmod a+x debian/scripts/misc/*</b>
           </div>
           <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
               <b>fakeroot debian/rules clean</b>
           </div>
           <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
               <b>fakeroot debian/rules editconfigs</b>
           </div>
        </p>
        <h2>Building The Kernel</h2>
        <p>
            At this point we will actually build the kernel so that it can be
            modified. This can be done by running three commands. Note that this 
            also takes quite a while, so get comfortable.
            <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
               <b>cd ubuntu-quantal</b>
               <small>Note that the name of the directory depends on the name of the
               release.</small>
           </div>
           <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
               <b>fakeroot debian/rules clean</b>
           </div>
           <div style="text-indent: 1em;">
               <b>fakeroot binary-headers binary-generic</b>
           </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have done everything correctly, you should see three package files
            in the directory above the ubuntu-quantal directory (if you followed this
            guide word for word it should be the home directory). These files will
            all have the .deb extension.
        </p>
        <h2>Installing the Kernel</h2>
        <p>
            Once the kernel is built, simply type the following commands to install it.
            <PRE><b>
            sudo dpkg -i linux*[version-number-here]*.deb
            sudo reboot
            </PRE></b>
        </p>
        <p>
        Congratulation, you have sucessfully added a system call to a kernel, then built and installed said kernel.
        </p>
