    A screenshot of top in linux showing the first process loaded by the kernel, which is
    the bottom process named init with a PID of 1.
first-process-mac.png
    A screenshot of Activity Manager showing the first process. Internet research suggests
    that the first process loaded by the kernel is launchd, with a PID of 1. However, 
    launchd lists kernel_task as its parent process and kernel_task has a PID of 0, which
    makes it seem like it may be the first process (it seems to be the kernel itself).
