The ways Mac OSX and Linux Ubuntu display seem pretty similar. They look to be represented in the same way, i.e. they are both listed under the controlling process when using ps. The main difference I noticed is based on what modifier you use for ps. Ps-eLf shows the main process and all the threads with the same command name, same PID and PPID, but a different LWP. If you just use ps -am (-M on Mac), the display is almost identical. They both display threads under the main process without a name. OSX shows all the threads as having the same PID as the main process, as does Linux (when using ps -eLf). In general, I can't see any difference in how they represent threads.
